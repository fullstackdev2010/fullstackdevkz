UbiScan is a scanner app built with Expo and native camera/OCR modules. It performs **on-device OCR** with a throttled frames pipeline and encrypts extracted text before syncing.

## Highlights

- **Fast:** sub-second OCR on mainstream Android hardware
- **Private:** AES-GCM encryption on device; optional sync with idempotent endpoints
- **Resilient:** offline queue with retry and backoff

## Tech stack

- Expo Router, React Native Reanimated, native camera module
- Lightweight OCR lib bound to a typed hook
- FastAPI backend with signed URLs, audit logging

## Lessons learned

- Region-of-interest and zoom hints reduce OCR cost dramatically
- Debouncing frames + a ring-buffer keeps UI smooth
- Encrypt early; resist temporary plaintext storage

```tsx
// pseudo: useOCR hook
const { start, stop, result } = useOCR({ region, debounce: 80, zoomHint: 1.2 });
useEffect(() => { start(); return stop; }, [start, stop]);
```

That’s the gist — check the case study for metrics and implementation structure.
