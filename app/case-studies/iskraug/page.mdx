# Iskra UG — Mobile Trading Suite

A cross‑platform **trading app** backed by **FastAPI + PostgreSQL** with a mobile client built on **Expo (React Native)**.
It delivers real‑time catalog browsing, cart → order flows, offline resilience, and a clean UI for field agents.

## Goals
- Catalog → Cart → Order with reliable sync.
- Simple stack: **Expo + API**, secure auth, predictable releases.
- Room to scale: search, analytics, batching, permissions.

## Scope
- Mobile client: authenticated sessions, protected screens, saved state.
- Server endpoints: catalog, cart, orders (pagination, filtering).
- Release pipelines and store‑ready artifacts.

## Key Features
- **Catalog & Search** — hierarchical browsing, quick search, filters.
- **Cart & Orders** — persistent cart, order draft/submit, status tracking.
- **Auth** — JWT sessions with `/register`, `/login`, `/me` and refresh.
- **Offline** — cached catalog, queued actions with retry.
- **Polish** — safe‑area fixes, stable tabs, accessible controls, haptics.

## Technical Highlights
- **Mobile** — Expo SDK 53, RN; Expo Router; Context for auth/session.
- **Backend** — FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy; JWT auth.
- **Networking** — Axios interceptors; error boundaries; toasts.
- **Build & Releases** — EAS builds/updates; Fastlane; GitHub Actions CI.
- **Observability** — Sentry crashes; request logging; feature flags.

## Performance & QA
- Fixed safe‑area + tab bar issues during SDK 53 migration.
- Lazy imports on heavy screens; memoized lists; image caching for catalog.
- Smoke tests for auth/cart/order flows; regression checklist per release.

## Results
- First internal build shipped in **2–4 weeks** with auth, catalog, orders.
- Weekly releases after; lower crash rate; faster build pipeline.

## Next
- Add **analytics** (search, add‑to‑cart, order events).
- Expand **offline** queue with conflict resolution.
- Integrate **payments** and exportable order summaries.
