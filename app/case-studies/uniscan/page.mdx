- Passphrase-protected exports (PDF / ZIP)  
- Biometric unlock (FaceID / Fingerprint)  
- Quick share & encrypted history view  

## Technical Highlights
- **Framework:** Expo 53 · React Native 0.79 · TypeScript  
- **Native modules:** expo-camera, expo-file-system, expo-image-manipulator  
- **Security:** expo-secure-store, expo-local-authentication, @noble/ed25519  
- **OCR:** react-native-tesseractocr, ML Kit Text Recognition  
- **UI:** react-native-paper, react-navigation, haptics feedback  
- **Performance:** lazy imports (−300 ms cold start), +22 % OCR throughput
