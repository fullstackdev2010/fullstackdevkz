  const poem0 = `The entropy’s hover
My worries protruding
Someday, all is over
The good things including

‘Cause winter is coming
Believable bluff
Not just, beer humming
As if winter stuff

Is hissing, subconscious
Onto weakness fleshly
With after taste noxious
And memories freshly …

I wake, with no wishes
Of sugary lust
Surrounding dishes
Of lovable crust

No effort supporting
To grow, the belly
Not soft spot transporting
To round-clock deli …

The entropy’s hover
My worries protruding
Someday, all is over
The good things including`;
  const poem1 = `A shape, what is it
Deformity strange
A down right cheat
Evolved rearrange

A face non existent
The absolute tinge
A hardly consistent
Vestigial fringe

My mind’s shaken over
Embrace it somehow
And go on slower
And sensibly out

Get fully in charge
Of shapes pending here
And hold on, in large
My shapelessness gear

I do stay connected
Bring forms, broken down
Live on, non protected
But no more bound …

An entity shapeless
I am, to admit
An entity nameless
I am, to permit`;
  const poem2 = `I am, a bit different
From rightful the world
My blood is refrigerant
That’s bringing the cold

Through colors deceitful
I try to express
My thoughts hot posess-full
Your mind to regress

I know I can
Entrap all your feelings
And make you, tough than
The most forgetful

Of all the unpleasant
Your blunders I had
With sign of the crescent
That’s driving you mad

I draw in your heart
With colors respectful
I make you be smart
But most regretful

Calm down, forgive me
I’ve suffered a lot
The black colored difference
My punishment gold`;
  const poem3 = `I’ve loosen my way
A long time ago
I’ve let the dismay
A weakness plateau

My life turn into
Somehow unconscious
And pierced up through
With wishes my noxious

I’ve cherished amiss
And seeked for unmeasured
A boundless bliss
Affectionately pleasured

But stumbled into
A bloody hand waving
To stop and review
My poisonous craving

To live feasting on
A pleasure and pain
A toxic breath drawn
Of dead-ending chain

With bleeding induced
To save my lost soul
The fate mine, has loosed
Her choking control`;
  const poem4 = `Dreams mine, are weird
Strange, they are still
Images smeared
Feelings are chilled

Brick walls around
Are harshly seared
Crumbling aground
Dreams mine, are weird

Guardian my angel
What’s wrong with you
Are you in danger
Cannot get through

Darkness surround
Glaring black
Crumbling aground
Visions mine slack

Perishing over
I shall no more
Feel you recover
My life’s the core

Back to the wall
So, am I
Hopelessly fall
Face down cry`;
  const poem5 = `Meaning, the myth
Growing somewhere
Swelling in width
Cheating the air

Pointless sooth
As always was
Searching the truth
Meaningless cause

Spiritual dazzling
Active the search
None, but a puzzling
Meaningless lurch

I do prefer
Meant not at all
Stop and deter
Meaningless crawl

Sweeping around
Things and events
Into compound
Mind’s discontents

Purely hushing
Versatile meaning
Meaningless something
Mindless time stealing`;
  const poem6 = `Thoughts, ugly thoughts
Pleasing repulsive
Forming the hordes
Of words convulsive

Whirling around
My mind eager
Loud resound
Painful disfigure

Why should I speak
Virtue disgusting
It is mystique
My soul’s trusting

Virtuous not
Never be granted
What I have got
Firmly’s been stranded

Loosed, ugly thoughts
Bitterly busting
Practice reports
Feverish lusting

Utter away,
To support virtue
Desperate, to say
Wanna revert to`;
  const poem7 = `My mind is weak
My limited feelings
Directed oblique
With useless proceedings

Keep dragging me on
Inside of a dream
With passing along
Some memories supreme

I fight them away
No sufferings to come
I won’t let’em stay
They are evil numb

The sort of disaster
That’s easily burnt
Into the black plaster
My life’s being turned

I’ve lived to discover
And learn myself through
What feverish mover
I’m turning into

My psyche is broken
I am losing parts
My pain is unspoken
My words, madly art`;

        <p className="text-white/70 italic text-base max-w-2xl mx-auto">
          Here is a collection of my psychedelic verses. They are a reflection of the imaginary states of the mind. As we experience transition between different moods, psychedelia comes in.

          <p className="text-white/70 italic text-base max-w-2xl mx-auto text-center mb-3">All is well, past and present. The past is comfortable and well-fed, the present is calm and serene. But, unfortunately, all good things come to an end. We make efforts, grow bellies and soft spots, but still subconsciously prepare for a long and harsh winter. This is the ruthless law of entropy.

          <p className="text-white/70 italic text-base max-w-2xl mx-auto text-center mb-3">In my understanding, people are all the same, regardless of race, living conditions and place of residence. Man is an absolute and independent entity that takes shape in accordance with the circumstances.
Probably, the division into countries and nations is an artificial event. It is simply connected with the origins of mankind and, ultimately, all nations will merge into one nation of earthlings, representatives of their planet. And then, the most interesting, overcoming the speed of light, warp technology and exploration of space and the Universe.
It is very sad that we are stuck in the past with wars and hatred for each other. (pause with commas)</p>

          <p className="text-white/70 italic text-base max-w-2xl mx-auto text-center mb-3">Fate is unfulfilled desires and hopes. Fate is something that we fear and do not want to happen to us. It is what we want to run away from. A weak person allows it to control himself. The strong one corrects and controls it by himself.
Some ones are so much weak that even the Fate herself is desperate to save their souls. (pause with commas)</p>

          <p className="text-white/70 italic text-base max-w-2xl mx-auto text-center mb-3">It is a strange but probable perception. Evil and good are the equal parts of human being. We are balancing on the line of choice. If you indulge yourself in lust and gluttony, then the balance changes towards evil, and expect yourself, ending up, with your back against the wall.

          <p className="text-white/70 italic text-base max-w-2xl mx-auto text-center mb-3">”The calling of each person is spiritual activity, a constant search for the truth and meaning of life.” This is an awesome and beautiful expression of the genius mind. Take it and share.
I fall sometimes to doubt everything around, psychedelia prevails over my feelings and my thoughts are fermented a bit.
I don’t trust meaning. It is imaginary. Meaning is a broken glass, scattered around and stinging with cheatfullness of expectations that rarely come true. I prefer to accept all the things and events as they are, without any underlying meanings. (pause with commas)</p>
