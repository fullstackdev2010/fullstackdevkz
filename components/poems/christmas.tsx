The miracle splendid
Magnificent, gorgeous, and wonderful true

Has made me a faithful
And warmly defended
A righteous, and open, and caring too

I am so much thankful
Attention His glorious
Has found me kneeling, and longing to be

An openly peaceful
And always victorious
In every His call, addressed onto me

I am so much pained
Of rudeness around
Of wars, raged unfair, against peaceful ones

I do humbly pray
For peace to be found
And let us be free, for new life of plans`;
  const poem1 = `They saw a star, that’s showed
A way, towards the place
A magic, flamed up road
To see the only Grace

That has been born, forever
For letting us, be free
And guide, our souls clever
From highs, onto the knee

They saw the moment, cherished
They made the moment, praised
With their hope, replenished
Proclaimed, that only Grace

Has come to rule, forever
The minds, all the hearts
In every mind, endeavor
And every heart, the arts

The mystery, so comfort
He is, for me and you
The sacrament triumphant
To every soul, the Clue`;
  const poem2 = `I was lost and forgotten
Right inside of my mind
My obedience’ been rotten
By the wishes refined

Sweetly poisoned away
They were heaps of the lies
Brought my soul into sway
I can’t stop or deny

A dependence on weakness
I was endlessly having
A delusion of sleekness
Was a treacherous padding

I have felt for a while
Since I’ve stepped into sin
An expansion hostile
I have grown within

My obedience, a rotten
Right inside of my mind
I was lost and forgotten
With the wishes refined`;
  const poem3 = `On the morning a star
I have seen in the skies
It was near and far
Healing hurt, to the eyes

Was her bright pure light
As a message descending
That there is, no night
With her darkness offending

Mine so weak, sinful soul
That’s got used to the night
That it’s time to control
All my fears despite

Life, I’ve lost, being blind
And dissolved in the frights
With obedience consigned
To the selfish delights

I’m enlightened to leave
All the sinful my past
And a hope conceive
With the Light everlast`;
  const poem4 = `I am grateful to know
All the joys, Hope brings
I am thankful, a flow
Spring of happiness rings

Deep inside, of my ardent
Open up, to the world
Heart, ones endless retardant
Now joyfully pearled

With the words, Truth has spoken
Which restored me inside
I’m hopefully woken
And awake with delight

I have totally changed
I am dreaming the Vow
All my life’s rearranged
It’s a new of me, now

I am grateful to know
There is, joy I need
And my happiness glow
I’m joyful indeed`;
  const poem5 = `The moment is peaceful
Surrounding glory
Ascending on, blissful
With magic, the story

To hold up my breath
With happiness springing
I’m kneeling at strength
With tremulous feelings

The Alfa forever
The One, always be
The Source of endeavor
The Omega quay

The King of the kings
The Light of my heart
The Mildness at win
The Meekness, impart

Come stay, to behold
The kings for The King
Have brought, gift of gold
With happiness ring

His birth, sacred reason
Revives, mine the core
The beautiful season
Our lives to restore

The moment is sacred
The Birth of the Greatness
I’m trembling, elated
And kneeling on, breathless`;

I wish you well, good luck and good mood. I’m sure everything will be fine with you and your families.
I am very much pleased, to think, that there is a great miracle in our life – Jesus Christ. He came and made us better, taught us righteous and open life.
He taught us, to be free, and not be afraid of the injustice and rudeness that surround us.
The beginning of every day, for me, is the words of gratitude to Christ, for this wonderful world created and blessed for us.
I am very sorry that there is a war and people are dying. I pray and ask the Lord that He does not leave us without his attention. (pause with commas)</p>

He accumulates sin and intolerance. But at the certain moment, he feels that an unknown force is calling him, purifying his thoughts and aspirations, mentally returning him to the time and place where he was born and blessed.
He comes to Christ in order to receive eternal life, which is the righteous pursuit of goodness and light.
I look back and realize how estranged and forgotten I was in my frivolous and refined world of disobedience and selfishness. (pause with commas)</p>
