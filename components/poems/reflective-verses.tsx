A social creature
An interest of fleeing
And able fly feature

Are most desired
At least to me only
The thoughts mine, conspired
Coarse modest and homely

I don’t like it, limit
The borders’ discretion
A rudeness implicit
Or hidden compression

Which reigning around
Suppressing me strongly
By strains, inner bound
And homefullness lonely

I want to be wild-free
From fetters self-forged
To full and high degree
Frivolity gorged …

Forgivable not
Mistakes mine are welcome
Light-mindedness hot
I’ve longed for, to have some`;
  const poem1 = `My life is a war
A hopelessly quiet
A closed up door
Insensibly private

It is, endless scope
Forbidden and restless
The sweet, soothing dope
My thoughts, fallen zestless

I try go on
Break boards, building out
The senses, dead born
Of black ruthless drought

That’s spreading around
As avalanche folly
Inherent unsound
Allegedly holy …

My life is a war
Inside, more than out
Of feelings burnt sore
And hatred devout

The flower of hope
I live on, perceive
The sweet, soothing dope
I’ve come to receive`;
  const poem2 = `I’m born of a sadness
In outer space
I lack, all the gladness
And even a trace

Of which, never found
Inside the abyss
I’ve fully been drowned
With welcoming hiss

I feel it discharged
The air of sorrow
The butterfly’s barged
Half-heartedly borrowed

And rose to company
The sheepish my look
Mistakenly-trumpery
On moodish, the hook

I’m here to say
I’m sorry-existence
Somehow display
A weakly consistence

To try, to have changed
And last for a while
In normal arranged
The effortless style`;
  const poem3 = `My life is a trap
Whatever direction
I’m wading the map
With heart insurrection

I want it, be changed
Reality stagnant
Make it, rearranged
Discarding waste remnant

I’m losing and lost
Inside reveries
Account not cost
For those devotees

That follow ardent
A leader, one legged
Who’s now retardant
Disabled a peg

My will’s not enough
Reality changed
It is, pompous bluff
That makes me estranged

…

Eleven much is
A victory double
We are, losing fears
Of fatalist trouble`;
  const poem4 = `It is a cool thing
Be part of a team
A slogan to sing
Do march in the stream

It’s true inspiration
A friend by your side
A biz conversation
The mutual pride

But once in a while
I feel something wrong
It’s clacking hostile
And gnashing prolonged

Inside of my mind
And then in the heart
A cogwheel’s assigned
To crack me apart

I turn and I tear
The suit bloody gray
I’m choking to bear
And gasp on decay

My life’s turned into
Moustached cogging wheel
That’s cutting me through
With weirdness real`;
  const poem5 = `I don’t know where
I’ve come so far
I’m gasping and stare
Indifferent ajar

With eyes, on the road
Glued hard, all the way
I’ve left my abode
And set off astray

I’ve lost all I had
Down there, a time
The home and the plaid
The sweet sonant chime

My inner despair
Turned harshly bizarre
My bestial flair
Has driven me far …

A home, not mine
Ahead to the right
Some circle malign
Has gathered tonight`;
  const poem6 = `She went it disgraceful
Malignant the fire
Afloat to nothing
Was love or desire

A tragedy softer
Emergency senses
Afloat emotions
Of struggling dances`;
  const poem7 = `Your love is a note
Inside of a bottle
You’re dreaming to dote
And endlessly coddle

A worthy someone
Not me, to possess
The one to become
Your love in excess

You dream and depict
The tender his touch
He is, my convict
I am, constant clutch

His love is a note
Inside of a bottle
His heart, is a boat
Of mindless twaddle

That’s sailing away
From here to there
A cold fish of prey
His heart’s of no care

Your love is a note
Inside of a bottle
Now’s always afloat
In careless twaddle`;
  const poem8 = `The world, little world
You’re heavy to hold
Have pity on me, for a while

My body is curled
My mind is whirled
I pray to be staying agile

They say, you’re the gold
You’re brilliant, but cold
And shining away, radiant through

The world, little world
You’re mighty uphold
The golden, my dreams, to pursue`;
  const poem9 = `I wait for the day
My rainy and gloomy
With chills, in the gray
That constantly sue me

With tireless waving
Towards an astray
I’m desperately craving
Your honest display

My fearless gladness
A poisonous snake
My elegant blackness
Your blunder mistake

Is always a puzzle
To bitter my heart
Why treacherous hustle
Is prudently smart

At risking it all
The white, into black
Dismaying the stall
Of orderly stack

Of wishes, your pleasant
I seem disapprove
With mind, effervescent
To blacken the move`;
  const poem10 = `Life is a desert
Burning and thirsty
With useless efforts
Tiresome bursty

Masquerade stepping
Tedious strife
Ominous trekking
Desert’s my life

Steps that I take
Anxious the masking
My thoughts, are fake
My mind’s, gasping

Wishes extreme
Reach the horizon
Desperate with dream
World, to enlighten

Close my eyes
Shut up the ears
Truthful allies
My rare tears

I will expose
Burning and bursty
Tiresome close
Masquerade thirsty`;
  const poem11 = `Genuine not
I was some ever
Lived like a god
Vainfully clever

Self praising blind
Strolled on around
Selfish inclined
Fell on the ground

Time, gorgeous tole
What’s wrong with me
Mine, perished soul
Fullscale degree

Rotted and vanished
Under the mask
Foolishly brandish
Self praising task

Led me away
Into nowhere
With present gray
Future despair`;
  const poem12 = `I am losing time
My words, scattered over
My thoughts are sublime
But deeds, of a drover

Obedient would seem
Appeared, the threesome
Hush, living a dream
The beautiful season

I close my eyes
Reach out, the hand
But stuck by the ties
Go back to repent

Why am I, so earthly
To live in the skies
Damn history’s dirty
Grand past is a lie

I try to entrap
The fortunes, that tease me
Take out a snap
To bitter displease me

My time’s running short
My words hurt me eager
Three beauties’ escort
An old intriguer`;
  const poem13 = `I stare at the door
Afraid of, the hidden
I’ve lost it before
Excited and ridden

Onto the emotions
That seemed, true and clean
I’ve plunged with devotion
Into the serene

A hatred and love
Were waiting me there
Distaste thereof
Becoming aware

That love is a poison
For beautiful hearted
And hatred is lovesome
For mercy departed

Rushed up, took the key
Have thrown, in the bay
I want to be free
And keep them away

There are many doors
Shut up, in my face
The hatred of love
Revenging its grace`;
  const poem14 = `A bullet or stone
The merciful gear
I’ve got to be prone
But still have no fear

I know, I might
Forget it and live
But poorest fright
Is striking to give

A way, risk intended
To hold up my breath
Am I, to be ended
Mechanical death

Life’s gorgeous a risk
That’s dwelling inside
My heart, burning brisk
Your mind, freezing blind

I try to have cleared
Emotional thread
An illness not feared
Imparting it sad

It’s falling in love
I am, much in terror
The risk’s leaden shove
An eminent error

I cannot survive
It’s better a bullet
Why am I, to thrive
I can, not to fool it.`;
  const poem15 = `Performance is over
Forgotten and fallen
By feverish lover
My heart’s being stolen

The smile I have seen
But back, turned to me
She’s all I have been
And more, than will be`;
  const poem16 = `Prehistoric flourish
From the past sublime
Been so freely nourished
Bloomed away, some time

Mystery the stonish
Like some thoughts of mine
Under-water garnished
Turned into the sign

That is shiny splendid
Like upon the time
True has got extended
Into magic mime …

Write upon the stone
Thoughts of mine, are true
Hope, they will be known
When I’m also through`;
  const poem17 = `On the shore, of land forgotten
Have to play, forgotten role
From nowhere, into nothing
Crawling on, without a goal

I am stumbling and gasping
Stepping over, lost and wrong
Are their souls of sparky lusting
Or as mine, a little prawn

I have lived a life of lazy
Someone never rushing to
Help somebody lost in hazy
And a miserable screw …

Yes, I’m sentenced, to the cold
Same as cold, as I have been
There could be, piece of gold
Here will be piece of thin

Little sharply, shaking icy
Always hard and cold for all
Never tried to live it dicey
Simply crawling off at all`;
  const poem18 = `Come here, little marvel
Come close, to me dear
You’re open and trustful
And know no fear

As I was up there
Respectful and trusty
In days of my youth
Was childishly gusty

I lived for a moment
To see in the eyes
A sparkle of gamely
And youthful surprise

Those days are no more
Enlighten my present
I live in the core
Of shapeless, unpleasant

A town of busy
Aggressive and moody
In time of my youth
Of flourishing beauty`;
  const poem19 = `I, do not, believe in witchcraft
Like discernment and insight
I’m avoiding contradictions
And believe in godly light

Would not say, that I am scary
Inner shaking through the night
I’m afraid, of darkly fairy
Playing tough with black and white

The impossible and gloomy
Things do happen on the way
When the white is over bloomy
And the black’s pretending gray

I am shaking at reflection
Being lost on endless day
If the white is not affection
And the black is not astray`;
  const poem20 = `I look in the mirror
So gracious and calmly
Mysterious darkness
Surrounds me timely

Been craving for love
Impossible minutes
But something inside
Was setting the limits

I look in the mirror
And treacherous doubly
Mysterious darkness
Is killing me calmly

My beauty is poison
My love is eleven
Impossible minutes
Of Paulo’s heaven

Enlive me somehow
To think of the last
When I was a muse
For boys in my past`;
  const poem21 = `Gourmania, evening
Mercedes is starting
Hello, come over
I’ll take you to Martin

The op has been scheduled
I’m nervous and jumpy
The time’s drawing near
My heart’s going pumpy

A beautiful lady
Said “ACHTUNG” and stuck
A needle into me …
Woke up

Guten tag

Carina is looking at me
With a smile
We’re waiting for Martin
He’ll come in a while

And now I see Him
My genius doctor
He’s shaking my hand
And smiling like actor

He’s perfect the star
Of the Helios truly
All women around
In love with him fully`;
  const poem22 = `I’m looking at you
In every direction
Up front and to side
You’ve lovely complexion

I cannot get in
Why am I attracted
You handsome enough
I’m over impacted

Oh, no, I’m here
To talk business matter
(But maybe at night
We’ll talk something better)

My head goes dizzy
I’m shaking inside
What business at all
I’ve fallen upright`;
  const poem23 = `I am an investor
My name is Nasdaq
Profound am I
And trusty as luck

The power liquid
Abundant with me
Come over my dear
I am your trustee

It’s time for a change
It’s time for the rule
A liquid adventure
The powerful tool

They say, step aside
You are, softly bubble
You will get us all
In equity trouble

I won’t let you down
The wolves, go fleeing
When I am around
To pump your well-being`;
  const poem24 = `I am coldly blooded
Impossible creature
The arris of courage
The only my teacher

Believe no chances
It is, too much risky
To fall off control
Depending on frisky

Ability moving
Or striking aback
There is no way
Misleading the track

The only thing matters
Advance of prediction
To strike at the core
With deadly infliction

I have all the power
In little my heart
I’m ready to strike
And break them apart`;
  const poem25 = `Little by little, I am passing over
Little by little, I’m losing my strength
My zeppelin, hardly can hover
Feeling alone, at the miserly end

Darkness is close, would I embrace it
Yes, I am grateful, warmly it seems
I am not scared, ready to face it
It is the part, of the radiant beams

Little by little, pain’s getting stronger
Shivering coldness, the snowy stones
Peaking around, stinging me longer
Shaking me hard, right to the bones

I am approaching, call it, eternal
Simply to say, a blackly abyss
Look up above, clouds fraternal
Down from me, cloudy mist

Close my eyes, was I a dreamer
Never disposed, to stony blues
Oxygen breath, nasty redeemer
Ready am I, to eternity cruise`;
  const poem26 = `Come over, my precious
Afraid, no need to
I’m very good natured
Confirm, it is true

Come close, my lovely
Would never mistreat you
Just look in my eye
Discreetly, I’m true

May look some unfriendly
It’s only misfortune
Was stricken by lightning
While whistling a tune

I’m proudly smiling
Come over, my darling
Come close, my precious
I am waiting for you`;
  const poem27 = `How come, compromise
Has not risen expected
Being caught, by surprise
In the sideways reflected

So beauty, I know
Is a relative matter
First impression’s, the flow
Stronger than any latter

In my mind, there were
So many collisions
Many images prime
And untimely decisions

I’ve been carrying out
After false recognition
What is beauty, no doubt
Compromised, a magician`;
  const poem28 = `I love you, my darling
And care so much
I love you within
And out, you catch

My hovering blues
Or piece of a sadness
Anxiety share
Or sorrow flatness

I love you, my darling
With all of my heart
I love you within
And out, the art

Of tender your passion
You share with me
I love you forever
And always will be`;
  const poem29 = `Working hard, do get exhausted
Falling on, my bed all times
Legal cases, docs unposted
Scattered round, broken rhymes

Being tough, and strong, somehow
Do survive the crazy world
From within dishevelled vow
Runs away towards its fold

Am I dreaming of a dwelling
Hidden far, in forest wild
All I want, escape the telling
And dissolve in snow mild

Look inside, what’s on my mind
Run away and get dismissed
Painful thought, has lost its grind
No strength I’ve to persist

Stop. What’s more? Forget it. Being
Lost, dishevelled, gotten past
Whole of mine is set to fleeing
Far away to forest cast`;
  const poem30 = `I have travelled around
With shamrock in my pocket
If I’m feeling much down
It is driving my rocket

On my palm, place it gently
Magic green, little leaflet
Precious more, than a jewel
Inner glamorous secret

I was born in the country
Ever green and surprising
Crystal clean in the air
Were my hopes arising

White and blue, lovely green
Those are, all my colours
Through the times of untrue
Were supporting my valours

Little house at sea
Always in, on my mind
Sweet my home, come to me
Better than, never find`;
  const poem31 = `My dreaming is childish
With eyes firmly closed
To fairy beauty
I’m always disposed

My dreaming is golden
My soul, isn’t stony
I’m childish a dreamer
With heart of a pony

They say it, all simple
The fables are falsely
Up mounted high
Or weighed down coarsely

I’m dreaming around
My eyes always closed
To stony falsehood
I’m not predisposed`;
  const poem32 = `Was gloomy my being
Throughout the night
Were thoughts on the run
To put up a fight

Against a tomorrow
Afraid, am I of
It’s painful to change
Or look up above

The forest my dwelling
I love you so much
You split me in two
You cut me with touch

Why am I to choose
Your darkfull despair
Or feverish light
Of endless unfair

Me, nothing foreseeing
Been long in the dark
Come over, Your Might
My Feverish Mark`;
  const poem33 = `Tonight, will I target
Or targeted creature
Somehow, become of
Uncertain the feature

Why should I, complain
Did much of the killing
If getting dismissed
Revealing the feeling

That’s burdening whole
The nature of preying
I see it from right
So hopelessly laying

Oh no, what nonsense
Am I, not of power
Come back into senses
Go out to devour

What’s there, from right
Lurking in, with persistence
I probably might
Given up, the resistance`;
  const poem34 = `Horizon’s on fire
So tired and bleeding
The shivering mire
My memories feeding

Entrapped and distracted
Like beams in the pool
My life’s of a fish
My mind’s of a fool

The ocean is gone
And nothing supported
My strength was the bridge
Untimely distorted

Entrapped and distracted
I stare off, firmly
Upon the horizon
That’s bleeding me warmly`;
