  const poem0 = `I am, always driven
Towards perfect curving
The nature, has given
My eyes long deserving

A way, running shameless
The view, bottom-up
And stay inner blameless
Not faulty abrupt

I want to get close
And sense all the lines
Unzip them utmost
The juicy divines

And turn you around
To burn, with my kiss
Then warmly surround
Insatiable bliss

Is now about
To burst out, right
And start, the devout
An innocent night

The ridge sliding round
Has waved us, good pluck
And senses unbound
And tireless luck`;
  const poem1 = `I’ve dreamt, of a dream
To live life, unbroken
I’ve pictured a scheme
My visions unspoken

Somehow appeared
And shocked me a bit
My sanity steered
True thoughtless commit

The deed, I’ve been waiting
Some days, mine, the last
I have been expecting
A lustfulness cast

My mind and body
Were longing so much
Sensatious and floody
Your fiery touch

I lay back and feel
I cannot get lost
In cold shaky thrill
I’ve always been tossed

By being indifferent
To open your move
And always consistent
The ardent your groove`;
  const poem2 = `It’s falling in love
A wonderful feeling
Calm waters above
The marvelous healing

I want pouring on
Like dreams mine, aquatic
Desirable strong
And deeply hypnotic

I dream, water beauty
Is mine to possess
I dream aqua cutie
Is close, undressed

Up snuggled to me
And breathing desire
We are, getting free
With intimate fire

How waters your deep
As I’m, diving in
How breathing’s your sweet
As I’m breathing in

How wonderful feeling
Your warm-water kiss
How wonderful feeling
I will always miss`;
  const poem3 = `I’d rather a fisher
Some day, to become
And fish for a kisser
To give me love, some

Affection and warmth
I’ve always been missing
And beautiful forms
I’ve longed to be kissing

I close the eyes
And stretch out the hand
The coveted prize
My mind’s harshly banned

And driven me off
Towards weird knocking
The wishes my soft
I’d rather be rocking

I turn back and smile
I’ve gained, what it takes
To break up, the trial
My mind, forcely makes`;
  const poem4 = `My manners were good
From early, the days
I’ve always withstood
Seduction and plays

A woman’s processed
In front of my being
So strongly depressed
With what I’ve been feeling

I firmly sat on
And prayed, to be safe
It’s devilish wrong
A perfect would say

To give in desire
Or let burning hunger
Unleash manly fire
To squeeze-overrun her

I struggle with feeling
Harsh grab lustful one
And have her a screaming
Let burst out spun …

My manners are good
I hate them so much
I’ve always withstood
Seduction, untouched`;
  const poem5 = `I need an attention
Whatever the kind
A mentally tensioned
Or feminine lined

Prohibited finely
On in, to the core
The playful my mind
I hate and adore

I try to persuade
My lust foolish self
To play disobeyed
The sin number twelve

That’s ad of success
For them, feel an envy
I shall not express it
Too frenzily friendly

Indulging into
The feminine tension
I’m languishing through
Distractive dimensioned`;
  const poem6 = `You know me not
The smoky, a devil
I am, dirty hot
And endlessly reveled

Your beautiful knees
I long to possess
And passionately squeeze
Her excellent breast`;
  const poem7 = `Purple and black
Freedom and love
You are my fragrant attraction

Awesome attack
Drive and blur of
I am your spoiled distraction

Come to me close
Let me inhale
All your magnificent beauty

You are my dose
Dimebag a veil
Toxic and glorious cutie

My only life
Rock the guitar
Longs to be sister of yours

Come to me close
My gorgeous star
Let us impress the amours`;
  const poem8 = `Reality’s real
Illusions, what else
A toxic appeal
Ruining my health

To hell with it, baby
Go on to undress
Let’s call it a day
No more of distress

A glass or a bottle
The two, both of
You wanna me coddle
I need drunken love

Come close, impressing
With heat of your kiss
The absolute blessing
Delicious my bliss`;
